### NOT--One's Complement Negation


|**Opcode**|**Instruction**|**Op/ **\newline{}**En**|**64-Bit **\newline{}**Mode**|**Compat/**\newline{}**Leg Mode**|**Description**|
|----------|---------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|
|F6 /2|NOT r/m8|M|Valid|Valid|Reverse each bit of r/m8.|
|REX + F6 /2|NOT r/m8*|M|Valid|N.E.|Reverse each bit of r/m8.|
|F7 /2|NOT r/m16|M|Valid|Valid|Reverse each bit of r/m16.|

|REX.W + F7 /2|NOT r/m64|M|Valid |N.E.|Reverse each bit of r/m64.|
### NOTES:


* In 64-bit mode, r/m8 can not be encoded to access the following byte registers if a REX prefix is used: AH, BH, CH, DH. 

### Instruction Operand Encoding


|Op/En|Operand 1|Operand 2|Operand 3|Operand 4|
|-----|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|M|ModRM:r/m (r, w)|NA|NA|NA|
### Description


Performs a bitwise NOT operation (each 1 is set to 0, and each 0 is set to 1) on the destination operand and stores the result in the destination operand location. The destination operand can be a register or a memory location.

This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically.

In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.


### Operation

```info-verb
DEST <- NOT DEST;
```
### Flags Affected


None


### Protected Mode Exceptions

#### #GP(0)
* If the destination operand points to a non-writable segment.
* If a memory operand effective address is outside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
* If the DS, ES, FS, or GS register contains a NULL segment selector.

#### #SS(0)
* If a memory operand effective address is outside the SS segment limit.

#### #PF(fault-code)
* If a page fault occurs.

#### #AC(0)
* If alignment checking is enabled and an unaligned memory reference is made while the current privilege level is 3.

#### #UD
* If the LOCK prefix is used but the destination is not a memory operand.

### Real-Address Mode Exceptions

#### #GP
* If a memory operand effective address is outside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.

#### #SS
* If a memory operand effective address is outside the SS segment limit.

#### #UD
* If the LOCK prefix is used but the destination is not a memory operand.

### Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions

#### #GP(0)
* If a memory operand effective address is outside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.

#### #SS(0)
* If a memory operand effective address is outside the SS segment limit.

#### #PF(fault-code)
* If a page fault occurs.

#### #AC(0)
* If alignment checking is enabled and an unaligned memory reference is made.

#### #UD
* If the LOCK prefix is used but the destination is not a memory operand.

### Compatibility Mode Exceptions



Same as for protected mode exceptions.


### 64-Bit Mode Exceptions

#### #SS(0)
* If a memory address referencing the SS segment is in a non-canonical form.

#### #GP(0)
* If the memory address is in a non-canonical form.

#### #PF(fault-code)
* If a page fault occurs.

#### #AC(0)
* If alignment checking is enabled and an unaligned memory reference is made while the current privilege level is 3.

#### #UD
* If the LOCK prefix is used but the destination is not a memory operand.
