### Description


A set of 8 single-precision/double-precision faulting-point memory locations pointed by base address BASE\esc{_}ADDR and index vector V\esc{_}INDEX with scale SCALE are gathered. The result is written into vector a register. The elements are specified via the VSIB (i.e., the index register is a vector register, holding packed indices). Elements will only be loaded if their corresponding mask bit is one. If an element's mask bit is not set, the corresponding element of the destination register is left unchanged. The entire mask register will be set to zero by this instruction unless it trig-gers an exception.

This instruction can be suspended by an exception if at least one element is already gathered (i.e., if the exception is triggered by an element other than the rightmost one with its mask bit set). When this happens, the destination register and the mask register (k1) are partially updated; those elements that have been gathered are placed into the destination register and have their mask bits set to zero. If any traps or interrupts are pending from already gathered elements, they will be delivered in lieu of the exception; in this case, EFLAG.RF is set to one so an instruc-tion breakpoint is not re-triggered when the instruction is continued.

If the data element size is less than the index element size, the higher part of the destination register and the mask register do not correspond to any elements being gathered. This instruction sets those higher parts to zero. It may update these unused elements to one or both of those registers even if the instruction triggers an exception, and even if the instruction triggers the exception before gathering any elements.

Note that:

*  The values may be read from memory in any order. Memory ordering with other instructions follows the Intel-64 memory-ordering model.

*  Faults are delivered in a right-to-left manner. That is, if a fault is triggered by an element and delivered, all elements closer to the LSB of the destination zmm will be completed (and non-faulting). Individual elements closer to the MSB may or may not be completed. If a given element triggers multiple faults, they are delivered in the conventional order.



*  Elements may be gathered in any order, but faults must be delivered in a right-to left order; thus, elements to the left of a faulting one may be gathered before the fault is delivered. A given implementation of this instruction is repeatable - given the same input values and architectural state, the same set of elements to the left of the faulting one will be gathered.

*  This instruction does not perform AC checks, and so will never deliver an AC fault.

*  Not valid with 16-bit effective addresses. Will deliver a #UD fault.

Note that the presence of VSIB byte is enforced in this instruction. Hence, the instruction will #UD fault if ModRM.rm is different than 100b.

This instruction has special disp8\htmlonly{\esc{*}}N and alignment rules. N is considered to be the size of a single vector element.

The scaled index may require more bits to represent than the address bits used by the processor (e.g., in 32-bit mode, if the scale is greater than one). In this case, the most significant bits beyond the number of address bits are ignored.

The instruction will #UD fault if the destination vector zmm1 is the same as index vector VINDEX. The instruction will #UD fault if the k0 mask register is specified.

#### VGATHERQPS (EVEX encoded version)
```info-verb
(KL, VL) = (2, 64), (4, 128), (8, 256)
FOR j <-  0 TO KL-1
    i <-  j * 32
    k <-  j * 64
    IF k1[j] OR *no writemask*
          THEN DEST[i+31:i] <-  
                MEM[BASE_ADDR + (VINDEX[k+63:k]) * SCALE + DISP]
                k1[j] <-  0
          ELSE *DEST[i+31:i] <-  remains unchanged*
    FI;
ENDFOR
k1[MAX_KL-1:KL] <-  0
DEST[MAX_VL-1:VL/2] <-  0
```
#### VGATHERQPD (EVEX encoded version)
```info-verb

FOR j <-  0 TO KL-1
    i <-  j * 64
    IF k1[j] OR *no writemask*
          THEN DEST[i+63:i] <-  MEM[BASE_ADDR + (VINDEX[i+63:i]) * SCALE + DISP]
                k1[j] <-  0
          ELSE *DEST[i+63:i] <-  remains unchanged*
